            <h2>Introducing Lyn</h2>
            <p>Lyn is an open source development project working to implement the Basis of Lightning Technology (BOLT),
                which is the standardized technical specification for the implementation of the Lightning Network.</p>
            <p>
                We're building Lyn to enable Lightning-protocol applications and services ontop of Bitcoin and Stratis
                blockchains, making Stratis even better for real world financial services and businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team behind Lyn is an extremely experienced team of software developers and engineers that already
                have many years of experience working on Blockchain technologies.
            </p>
            <p>There are other existing implementations of Lightning, but none that is based upon C# and .NET. We
                believe that an alternative implementation based on .NET, will increase innovation and adoptions among
                more developers globally.

            <h2>A Stratis Decentralized Accelerator proposal</h2>
            <h3>Lightning node in C#</h3>
            <p>
                We make a bid to the Stratis Decentralized Accelerator for funding to develop a lightning node in C#,
                this will be deployed on top of the Stratis network but will also be a scaling solution for the Stratis
                technology stack.</p>
            <p>
                C# is the 5th most used language and is very popular with enterprise and corporate environments,
                currently C# solutions that want to interact with the lightning network will need use bindings to
                external dlls and/or write extensions in unfamiliar languages, having a lightning implementation in C#
                using industry common practices will allow developers to easy extend lightning and the usage of native
                packages to interact with the lightning network.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lightning has several layers to it, generally lightning users run all layers locally and also often a
                local the Bitcoin node, however some layers of lightning can be run in cloud like environments, we
                believe that to bring lightning to mass adoption will require taking some of that burden off users, our
                focus will be a solution that is cloud aware (mainly the Azure cloud), multi chain and with support for
                multi users in mind.

            <h2>What is lightning?</h2>
            <p>Lightning is a layer two scaling protocol that is sits on top of the Bitcoin network, the lightning
                protocol is designed with multichain support in mind and can be used to scale other blockchains such as
                the Stratis network.
                On the lightning network participants open bidirectional payment channels between them and can then send
                bitcoin payments off chain, but nodes can also advertise their channels on the lightning gossip network
                and respond to payment routing requests for a competitive fee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lightning is designed to be extendible with the ability to add many new message types, lightning is also
                designed with privacy in mind such that all communications between peers are private and encrypted,
                payment routing uses onion like layers to hide recipients identity and protect privacy (when routing a
                payment a node does not know who initiated the payment and who it is for)</p>
            <h3>Applications of lightning</h3>
            <p>
                Anything that uses payments (and micro payments) can integrate lightning such as:

            <ul>
                <li>messaging apps (Sphinx)</li>
                <li>social media networks</li>
                <li>games (unity)</li>
                <li>instant deposit to exchanges</li>
                <li>smart contact protocol like RGB are being developed on top of lightning</li>
                <li>submarine swaps (offchain to onchain transactions)</li>
                <li>cross chain onchain swaps (using submarine swaps from a Bitcoin lightning channel to a Stratis
                    mainchain address)</li>
                <li>cross chain off chain swaps (cross chain lightning to lightning swaps offer complete privacy)</li>
                <li>liquidity markets (loopin)</li>
                <li>static invoices (bolt12)</li>
            </ul>

            And we believe lots more features will come up over time.
