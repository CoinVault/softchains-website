            <h2>Introducing Lyn</h2>
            <p><img class="drawing-right" src="assets/undraw_Hello_re_3evm.svg">Lyn is an open source development
                project working to implement the Basis of Lightning Technology (BOLT),
                which is the standardized technical specification for the implementation of the Lightning Network.</p>
            <p>
                We're building Lyn to enable Lightning-protocol applications and services ontop of Bitcoin and Stratis
                blockchains, making Stratis even better for real world financial services and businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team behind Lyn is an extremely experienced team of software developers and engineers that already
                have many years of experience working on Blockchain technologies.
            </p>
            <p>There are other existing implementations of Lightning, but none that is based upon C# and .NET. We
                believe that an alternative implementation based on .NET, will increase innovation and adoptions among
                more developers globally.

            <h2>A Stratis Decentralized Accelerator proposal</h2>
            <h3>Lightning node in C#</h3>
            <p><img class="drawing-right" src="assets/undraw_Development_re_g5hq.svg">
                We make a bid to the Stratis Decentralized Accelerator for funding to develop a lightning node in C#,
                this will be deployed on top of the Stratis network but will also be a scaling solution for the Stratis
                technology stack.</p>
            <p>
                C# is the 5th most used language and is very popular with enterprise and corporate environments,
                currently C# solutions that want to interact with the lightning network will need use bindings to
                external dlls and/or write extensions in unfamiliar languages, having a lightning implementation in C#
                using industry common practices will allow developers to easy extend lightning and the usage of native
                packages to interact with the lightning network.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lightning has several layers to it, generally lightning users run all layers locally and also often a
                local the Bitcoin node, however some layers of lightning can be run in cloud like environments, we
                believe that to bring lightning to mass adoption will require taking some of that burden off users, our
                focus will be a solution that is cloud aware (mainly the Azure cloud), multi chain and with support for
                multi users in mind.

            <h2>What is lightning?</h2>
            <p><img class="drawing-right" src="assets/undraw_nakamoto_2iv6.svg">Lightning is a layer two scaling
                protocol that is sits on top of the Bitcoin network, the lightning
                protocol is designed with multichain support in mind and can be used to scale other blockchains such as
                the Stratis network.
                On the lightning network participants open bidirectional payment channels between them and can then send
                bitcoin payments off chain, but nodes can also advertise their channels on the lightning gossip network
                and respond to payment routing requests for a competitive fee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lightning is designed to be extendible with the ability to add many new message types, lightning is also
                designed with privacy in mind such that all communications between peers are private and encrypted,
                payment routing uses onion like layers to hide recipients identity and protect privacy (when routing a
                payment a node does not know who initiated the payment and who it is for)</p>
            <h3>Applications of lightning</h3>
            <p>
                Anything that uses payments (and micro payments) can integrate lightning such as:

            <ul>
                <li>messaging apps (Sphinx)</li>
                <li>social media networks</li>
                <li>games (unity)</li>
                <li>instant deposit to exchanges</li>
                <li>smart contact protocol like RGB are being developed on top of lightning</li>
                <li>submarine swaps (offchain to onchain transactions)</li>
                <li>cross chain onchain swaps (using submarine swaps from a Bitcoin lightning channel to a Stratis
                    mainchain address)</li>
                <li>cross chain off chain swaps (cross chain lightning to lightning swaps offer complete privacy)</li>
                <li>liquidity markets</li>
                <li>static invoices (bolt12)</li>
            </ul>

            And we believe lots more features will come up over time.

            <h2>Technical proposal</h2>

            <p>
                Our proposal comes in two parts a full **lightning node** implementation based on the lightning RFC also
                referred to BOLTs (Basis of Lightning Technology),
                an implementation which is compatible with the Bitcoin network and the Stratis network (a multi-chain
                lightning node).
                The second part is about the **applications** that use the lightning node implementation such as swaps, watchtowers
                and routing services which will be targeted for the Stratis master nodes.
            </p>

            <h3>Lightning Node</h2>
                <p>
                    The following sections describe the BOLTs we will implement that are required to run a lightning
                    node.
                    It also includes a docker based test suite to test and insure compatibility between the existing
                    implementation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All the BOLT codebase will come in the form of nuget packages, this are lightning library components
                    that can be used in C# applications such as web, mobile and even games (with unity).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Work has already started on an implementation called Lyn (lightning in Danish).
                    The codebase can be found here [Lyn](https://github.com/block-core/lyn)
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    For the full lightning implementation the node will be compatible with the popular UI for lightning 
                    called RTL (Ride The Lightning), and later at the second phase of the proposal we'll work on a light 
                    weight UI that will use lightning service providers (such as master nodes) for some of the work that
                    can be delegated away.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The lightning node adds scaling capabilities to the already wide Stratis technology stack, we will develop
                    the node with cloud architecture in mind, parts of the workload required to successfully route payments in lighting 
                    can be delegated to dedicated cloud service providers or master nodes. 
                </p>
            
                <h3>- Payment Channels (BOLT1,2,3,5,8,9)</h3>
                <p>
                    Payment channels allow opening commitment transactions between two participants and sending payments
                    off chain in a trustless setup.
                    This include a node that can crate funding transactions to open channels, the commitment transaction
                    so secure the funds
                    and the HTLCs (hash timed locked outputs) to make off chain payments between participants.
                    It also includes lots of boilerplate components such as the gossip messages, noise protocol the
                    interaction with base layer etc..
                </p>
                <p>
                    A big part of this section is already implemented (BOLT1,3,8,9) in the Lyn repo.
                </p>

                <h3>- Payment Routing (BOLT4,11)</h3>
                <p>
                    Onion routing (built of layers like an onion) refer to the ability to route payments between
                    participants who don't share a channel directly,
                    an onion routed packet is used to route a payment from an origin node to a final node through a
                    number of intermediate nodes, called hops.
                    The payment initiator node, who knows the public keys of each intermediate, create the onion packet
                    in such a way that each node only knows
                    it's previous and next route but can't read information of any participant or how many hope this
                    route has.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Invoicing, defining protocol messages where participants can request payments over Lightning.
                </p>

                <h3>- Payment Channel Discovery (BOLT7,10)</h3>
                <p>
                    Node and channel discovery serve two different purposes, Node discovery allows nodes to broadcast
                    information about themselves, so that other
                    nodes can open connections and establish payment channels with them. Channel discovery allows the
                    creation and maintenance of a local
                    view of the network's topology, so that a node can discover routes to desired destinations.
                    Discovery is done using gossip messages, each node that receives gossip messages stores it and routs
                    it on to its peers.
                </p>

                <h3>Lightning Applications</h2>
                    <p>
                        Features that will leverage the lightning node and are intended to be used by Stratis master
                        nodes
